# IRCTCAPP-JAVA-Project-Console-Based
A Java console-based IRCTC Railway Ticket Booking System with user login, registration, train search, seat availability, multi-passenger booking, PNR generation, payment simulation, ticket printing, cancellation, OTP-based password change, colored UI, animations, and sound effects using Java libraries.

his project is a Java-based IRCTC Railway Ticket Booking System, developed as a console application using Core Java concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming, Collections, Date & Time API, and file-based audio playback. The system allows users to register, log in, view available trains, check seat availability, book tickets with multiple passenger details, generate unique PNR numbers, view and cancel booked tickets, and verify booking details. It includes payment simulation through UPI or card, GST calculation, and a secure password change option via OTP verification. For enhanced user experience, the project features colored console UI, animated text loading, Unicode ticket printing format, and background music effects using Java sound libraries. The application uses in-memory storage for users, trains, and tickets, and supports Sleeper, AC, and Tatkal classes with automatic seat deduction and restoration. This project demonstrates strong practical implementation of Java fundamentals with a realistic railway reservation flow.
